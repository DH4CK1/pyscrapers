- once you have a course number (lets say 28705)
	you need to download its page from:
		https://www.drumeo.com/members/lessons/courses/28705
	and then look for urls like this:
		<a href="https://www.drumeo.com/laravel/public/members/lessons/courses/28707" class="course-lesson">
	which will give you all the lessons within the course.
	to get the course materials look for a url like this:
	<a class="columns large-3 medium-4 small-6 end" href="//drumeo.s3.amazonaws.com/courses/resource-files/dci-93.pdf" download>Download
All Course Resources</a>
	and just get it from s3.

- once you have a lesson number (lets say 28707)
	you need to download its page from:
		https://www.drumeo.com/members/lessons/courses/28707
	and take a url like this from it:
		<div class="jw-player-container flex-video widescreen vimeo" data-video-id="200057665" data-video-content-id="28707" data-video-duration="428" data-video-start-time="0" data-video-total-time-watched="0" data-video-load-url="https://www.drumeo.com/laravel/public/video-data-api/get/vimeo/200057665">
	from that you get the video id (200057665)

- once you know the video number [num] you get:
	https://www.drumeo.com/laravel/public/video-data-api/get/vimeo/[num]
	and you get a json with the links to the videos.
	you pick the video with the highest quality and download it.
