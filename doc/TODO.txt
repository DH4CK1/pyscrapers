- add scraper for pinterest.
- the current instagram downloader does not download videos
	It does download images for the videos.
	It currently download number of images = number of user
	posts + 1 (the main image of the user).
	So it downloads the images for the videos just not the
	videos themselves.
	fix this.
- add flag to control whether or not we add cookies from firefox
	or google or not at all.
	(default should be firefox).
- add scraper for mamba.ru.
- do website for this project and publish to github.
	use sphinx
- use sessions in all of the scrapers and not just in the instagram one.
- take some ideas from the google 'photograbber' project here:
	https://code.google.com/archive/p/photograbber/downloads
- use the facebook graph API to download from facebook:
	https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/photo
- use the instagram API to create another crawler based on their API.
